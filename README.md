# Gemini Batch Prediction Framework

> **Google Summer of Code 2025 Project**  
> Creating efficient video content analysis through intelligent batching and context caching with the Gemini API

**Organization:** Google DeepMind

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project develops a framework for efficiently analyzing educational video content using Google's Gemini API. By implementing intelligent batch processing and context caching strategies, we aim to achieve **4-5x reduction in API calls** while maintaining high-quality responses for educational content analysis.

### Key Goals
- **Batch Processing**: Group related questions to minimize redundant API calls
- **Context Caching**: Leverage Gemini's caching capabilities for repeated analysis
- **Conversation Memory**: Maintain coherent follow-up question handling
- **Video Analysis**: Support YouTube URLs and uploaded video files

## 🚀 Current Status

**Week 1 (June 2-8, 2025)**: Foundation & Core Text Processing ✅ **COMPLETED**
- ✅ Production-ready API client with authentication and error handling
- ✅ Comprehensive batch processing framework for text content
- ✅ Efficiency tracking utilities with quality analysis
- ✅ Professional documentation and examples
- ✅ **Bonus**: Visualization module for efficiency analysis
- ✅ **Bonus**: Scaling experiments demonstrating 3-6x efficiency gains

**Week 2 (June 9-15, 2025)**: Enhanced Error Handling & Testing ✅ **COMPLETED**
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite (95%+ coverage across unit and integration tests)
- ✅ Advanced configuration management with flexible API tier support
- ✅ Professional error handling and retry mechanisms
- ✅ Performance optimization and rate limiting enhancements
- ✅ Modern packaging system with optional dependencies
- ✅ Professional documentation and setup guides

**Week 3 (June 16-22, 2025)**: File Processing & Multimodal Foundation 🟡 **STARTING**
- 🚧 Files API integration and directory processing
- 🚧 Video processing foundation (YouTube URLs)
- ⚪ Advanced caching implementation (planned for Week 4-5)

## 📦 Installation

```bash
# Basic installation
pip install -e .

# With visualization capabilities (recommended for demos)
pip install -e .[viz]

# With development dependencies
pip install -e .[dev]

# Full installation
pip install -e .[viz,dev]
```

### API Key Setup
Get your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://ai.dev/) and configure:
```bash
# Create .env file
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.0-flash  # Optional: defaults to optimal model for tier
```

See [docs/SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md) for detailed configuration options.

## 🔥 Quick Start

### Flexible Initialization
```python
from gemini_batch import GeminiClient, BatchProcessor

# Environment-based (recommended)
client = GeminiClient()
processor = BatchProcessor()

# See docs/SETUP.md for advanced configuration options
```

### Basic Usage
```python
# Simple content generation
response = client.generate_content("Explain quantum computing")

# Efficient batch processing
content = "Educational content about AI..."
questions = ["What is AI?", "How does it work?", "What are applications?"]

results = processor.process_text_questions(content, questions)
print(f"🚀 Efficiency: {results['efficiency']['token_efficiency_ratio']:.1f}x improvement")
print(f"💰 API calls reduced: {len(questions)} → {results['metrics']['batch']['calls']}")

# Access answers
for i, answer in enumerate(results['batch_answers'], 1):
    print(f"Q{i}: {answer[:100]}...")
```
