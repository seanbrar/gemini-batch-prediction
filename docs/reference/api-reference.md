Stability and versioning

- The core public API is approaching v1.0. From 1.0 onward, breaking changes will follow semantic versioning and include a deprecation/transition period.
- The documented internals are provided for transparency but are not part of the stability contract.
- Decoupled modules under `extensions/` and the upcoming `research/` area are pre-1.0 and may change without deprecation until their first stable release.
