# Reference

Purpose: Precise, factual documentation of commands, types, and APIs. Minimal prose, maximum exactness.

What you'll find:

- CLI commands and options
- Module- and type-level API reference
- Configuration schema and defaults
- Internals reference for maintainers

When to use:

- You need the exact signature, option, or default.
- You’re validating behaviour or limits, not learning concepts.
