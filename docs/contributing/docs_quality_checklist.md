# Docs Quality Checklist (Contributor‑Friendly)

Use this checklist to keep pages clear, task‑fit, and reproducible.

For every new or updated page:

- Purpose & Fit: Choose one type—Tutorial, How‑To, Reference, or Explanation. State the outcome and how to verify success near the top.
- Audience Success: Make assumptions explicit (environment, skills, cost). Link terms to the Glossary. Avoid insider knowledge.
- Actionability: Provide runnable, end‑to‑end snippets with imports/env and expected output or checks. Include recovery steps for common errors.
- Truth & Precision: Keep facts in sync with code. Note defaults and limits. Avoid duplication—link to the relevant Reference/API page.
- Structure & Navigation: Use scannable headings. Add “See also” links to adjacent Tutorial/How‑To/Reference/Explanation content.
- Style & Voice: Write clearly and actively. Use Python 3.13‑idioms and type hints. Use admonitions sparingly. Provide alt text for diagrams.
- Safety: Never include secrets. Call out cost/tier and rate‑limit notes next to risky steps. Note telemetry/privacy flags when relevant.
