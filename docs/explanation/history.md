# Project History & GSoC Overview

This project originated as a GSoC effort and matured into a production‑grade batching and analysis framework. The documentation separates history (why things evolved) from present‑day usage (how to use it now).

Highlights:

- Core seam: a single executor/command pipeline with strict types and testable stages.
- Architecture rubric: a living checklist used to steer design toward simplicity and robustness.
- Iterations: early research ideas (e.g., prompting strategies, cache policies) were refined through ADRs and contract‑first tests.

How to navigate history:

- Read “Architecture at a Glance” for the current shape.
- Browse ADRs for decisions and tradeoffs; they link to relevant concepts and specs.
- Deep Dives contain formal specifications if you are extending internals.

What to use today:

- Tutorials and How‑to guides reflect the current API surface and recommended workflows.
- Reference documents are the single source of truth for commands, types, and defaults.

## GSoC 2025 Summary (Archived)

The following summarizes the original GSoC 2025 delivery. It captures the phasing and outcomes during the program for historical context.

### Foundation & Multimodal Processing (Weeks 1–3) — Completed

- Production‑ready API client with comprehensive error handling and rate limiting
- Unified interface for any content type (text, files, URLs, directories, YouTube)
- Files API integration and multi‑source analysis capabilities

### Advanced Features (Weeks 4–6) — Completed

- Intelligent context caching with up to 75% cost reduction
- Multi‑turn conversation memory with session persistence and context overflow handling
- Performance monitoring infrastructure and architectural modernization

### Professional Infrastructure (Weeks 7–8) — Completed

- Comprehensive testing foundation with characterization tests and 95%+ coverage
- Modern CI/CD pipeline with automated releases and changelog generation
- Professional Python tooling (ruff, mypy, pre‑commit) and semantic versioning

### Pipeline Architecture Implementation (Weeks 9–11) — Completed

- Command pipeline architecture with async handler pattern
- Legacy system removal and API surface refinement
- Comprehensive documentation and testing infrastructure

### Final Delivery (Week 12) — Completed

- Production readiness verification and final optimizations
- Comprehensive cookbook with 25+ practical recipes
- Official extensions suite with comprehensive testing
