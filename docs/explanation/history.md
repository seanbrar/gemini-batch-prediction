# Project History & GSoC Overview

This project originated as a GSoC effort and matured into a production‑grade batching and analysis framework. The documentation separates history (why things evolved) from present‑day usage (how to use it now).

Highlights:

- Core seam: a single executor/command pipeline with strict types and testable stages.
- Architecture rubric: a living checklist used to steer design toward simplicity and robustness.
- Iterations: early research ideas (e.g., prompting strategies, cache policies) were refined through ADRs and contract‑first tests.

How to navigate history:

- Read “Architecture at a Glance” for the current shape.
- Browse ADRs for decisions and tradeoffs; they link to relevant concepts and specs.
- Deep Dives contain formal specifications if you are extending internals.

What to use today:

- Tutorials and How‑to guides reflect the current API surface and recommended workflows.
- Reference documents are the single source of truth for commands, types, and defaults.
