# Token Counting & Estimation – Conceptual Overview

> Status: Implemented on a separate branch. This page describes the final model adopted by ADR-0002; see planner and adapters.

## Purpose & Scope

This document explains how Gemini Batch **estimates** token usage to support planning (batch sizing, caching decisions, and cost predictability). It is vendor-neutral by design and integrates cleanly with the Command Pipeline.

**In scope**:

- The problem this system solves and the design forces behind it
- The conceptual model (estimation adapters, uncertainty, planner integration)
- Policies for conservative decisions and vendor neutrality
- Observability and validation at execution time

**Not in scope**:

- API signatures or code (see deep dive)
- Step-by-step usage (see How-tos)
- Provider SDK mechanics (they are isolated to the API Handler)

---

## Problem Statement

The planner must decide *before execution* how to batch, whether to use caching, and whether a request risks exceeding model limits—**without** calling any provider SDK. Vendor token counters can be biased (content-type dependent), which leads to mis-sized batches, avoidable failures, or missed caching opportunities.

**Goals**:

- Provide **reliable, fast, SDK-free** estimates
- Make **uncertainty explicit** (ranges, not single numbers)
- Keep the planner **provider-agnostic**
- **Validate** estimates post-execution (observability), without coupling planning to execution

**Non-goals**:

- Real-time token tracking during streaming generation
- Sub-token precision
- Compensating for *every* vendor up front (adapters unlock this over time)

---

## Design Forces

- **Simplicity:** Estimation must remain small, pure, and testable.
- **Accuracy vs. speed:** Favor fast, conservative estimates with explicit uncertainty.
- **Isolation of concerns:** No SDK calls outside the API Handler.
- **Vendor neutrality:** Use **adapters** for provider-specific heuristics and bias compensation.
- **Determinism:** Same inputs → same estimate.
- **Observability:** Compare estimates vs. actuals to detect drift over time.

---

## Conceptual Model

### Core idea

A **pure estimation pipeline** that returns a **range** (`min`, `expected`, `max`) plus a **confidence** value. Provider-specific quirks and compensations live in **estimation adapters**.

```text
Sources & Prompts
↓
[ Estimation Adapter ]  —pure, deterministic, no SDK—
↓
TokenEstimate {min, expected, max, confidence, breakdown}
↓
[ Execution Planner ] → uses conservative policy (typically `max`)
```

### Roles

- **Estimation Adapter (vendor-specific):** Encapsulates heuristics and compensation (e.g., image/video bias). Multiple adapters can exist (Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic), selected by model/provider.
- **TokenEstimate:** Conceptual data object capturing lower/expected/upper bounds and overall confidence; may include a per-source breakdown.
- **Execution Planner:** Consumes a **single** aggregate estimate to make decisions (batch sizing, cache eligibility, truncation policy).
- **API Handler (validation only):** Records actual usage after execution for telemetry/validation. It does **not** feed back into planning during the same run.

---

## Policies (conservative by construction)

> **Note on legacy iteration:** The first version wrapped `count_tokens()` with content-type adjustments and threshold buffers. It improved local accuracy but increased coupling and hidden policy. The new adapter-based estimator restores simplicity and testability while keeping conservative decisions.

- **Planning uses `max`** of the estimate to avoid cache misses and oversize batches.
- **Error tolerance:** Prefer slight over-estimation to under-estimation (safer batching).
- **Unknowns:** Unknown content types fall back to conservative byte-based heuristics with lower confidence.
- **Mixed content:** Confidence is reduced for heterogeneous batches, widening the range.

### Cache policy and floors (ADR‑0011)

Cache creation is governed by a small, explicit policy resolved from configuration and hints:

- **First‑turn‑only by default:** Shared cache creation is attempted only on the first turn (empty history). Later attempts are opt‑in via `CachePolicyHint(first_turn_only=False)`.
- **Confidence floor skip:** Skip creation when both are true: `estimate.max_tokens < floor` and `estimate.confidence ≥ conf_skip_floor` and `respect_floor=True`.
- **Floor resolution:** Prefer model capability thresholds (`explicit_minimum_tokens` → `implicit_minimum_tokens`), otherwise use 4096; override via `CachePolicyHint(min_tokens_floor=...)`.
- **Planner purity:** The planner applies this policy as a pure data transform. It does not call any provider SDK or read content.

## Data Flow (within the pipeline)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  autonumber
  participant App as Developer App
  participant Exec as Executor
  participant Plan as Execution Planner
  participant Est as Estimation Adapter
  participant API as API Handler
  participant Tele as Telemetry

  App->>Exec: submit(Command with sources/prompts)
  Exec->>Plan: plan(resolved_sources, config)
  Plan->>Est: estimate(per-source) + aggregate
  Est-->>Plan: TokenEstimate {min, expected, max, confidence, breakdown}
  Plan-->>Exec: ExecutionPlan (+ TokenEstimate, + CacheDecision)
  Exec->>API: execute(ExecutionPlan)
  API->>Tele: record(actual_tokens, accuracy_ratio, in_range)
  API-->>Exec: Result
```

**Key constraint:** Estimation occurs **in the planner**; **no SDK** calls are made. Actual usage is observed **only** in the API Handler.

---

## Quality Attributes

- **Testability:** Pure estimation functions; no network or SDK dependency.
- **Robustness:** Conservative bounds protect batching/caching decisions from drift.
- **Extensibility:** New providers are new adapters—no changes to the planner.
- **Transparency:** Estimates carry confidence and breakdowns for interpretability.
- **Performance:** O(n) aggregation over sources; negligible overhead for planning.

---

## Failure Modes & Mitigations

- **Bias drift:** Provider changes behavior → validation metrics detect accuracy degradation → update adapter version/bias table.
- **Unknown MIME/content types:** Fall back to conservative heuristics; lower confidence logged.
- **Extreme content sizes:** Clamp or cap estimates; planner uses policy to rebatch or truncate.
- **Mixed-model batches:** Partition by provider/model where practical; otherwise apply worst-case rules and reduced confidence.

---

## Observability & Validation

- **During planning:** Emit estimation metrics (e.g., `estimate.expected_tokens`, `estimate.max_tokens`, `confidence`, per-source breakdown).
- **During execution (API Handler):** Emit validation metrics (e.g., `actual_tokens`, `accuracy_ratio`, `in_range`).
- **Drift tracking:** Periodically review `accuracy_ratio` distributions to retune bias factors.

> Validation is **observation**, not a feedback loop. Plans are not retroactively changed mid-run.

---

## Legacy Relationship

Historically, token logic was intertwined with client and cache decisions, and sometimes relied on vendor counters that exhibited content-type biases. The new approach:

- **Extracts estimation into pure adapters**
- **Keeps the planner vendor-agnostic**
- **Shifts provider quirks to per-adapter compensation**
- **Validates after execution** without entangling planning with provider SDKs

---

## Legacy Comparison (What We Changed and Why)

The first iteration (`client/token_counter.py`) wrapped **Gemini’s `count_tokens()`** with content-type adjustments and threshold-specific heuristics. It attempted high precision but introduced complexity and coupling:

### Observed characteristics (legacy)

- **SDK coupling in planning** – `count_tokens()` call inside a planning helper.
- **Heuristic sprawl** – per-type multipliers, mixed-content analysis, threshold “danger zones.”
- **Hidden policy** – caching strategy decisions embedded in estimation logic.
- **Stateful branching** – behavior varied by flags (implicit/explicit caching) and config lookups.
- **Complex fallbacks** – bespoke “rough estimate” path when API failed.

### Resulting issues

- Hard to reason about correctness (many code paths).
- Tight coupling to provider SDK and configuration internals.
- Tests depended on mocked provider calls and specific config shapes.
- Drift detection was implicit; no structured telemetry to validate estimates post-run.

### What the new design changes

| Concern | Legacy approach | New approach (Hybrid A+E) |
|---|---|---|
| **Where estimation runs** | Inside client-like helper (calls SDK) | Inside **Execution Planner**, **no SDK** |
| **Provider quirks** | Interleaved with policy | Isolated in **Estimation Adapter** (Gemini, …) |
| **Output form** | Point estimate (plus ad-hoc buffers) | **Range** (min/expected/max) + **confidence** |
| **Caching decisions** | Embedded in estimator (threshold “danger zone”) | Planner policy uses **`max_tokens`**; thresholds live in model capabilities |
| **Mixed content** | Branchy content inspection | Confidence reduction + conservative aggregate |
| **Failure handling** | Custom rough-estimate paths | Estimators are pure; no I/O, no failures; validation happens later in API Handler |
| **Drift detection** | Implicit, manual | **Telemetry** records estimate vs. actual for review |

### Keep from legacy

- Conservative bias toward over-estimation to avoid cache misses.
- Awareness that images/videos behave differently than text.
- Attention to thresholds that affect caching decisions.

### Drop or relocate

- SDK calls and threshold tweaking inside estimation (moved to planner policy + model capability data).
- Flag-driven behavior and hidden coupling to config.
- Large “safety margin” branches and content sniffing logic.

### Lessons Learned (mapped to rubric)

- **Simplicity (↑):** A small, pure estimator with explicit ranges replaces many special cases.
- **Data-centricity (↑):** `TokenEstimate` models uncertainty; planner applies policy in one place.
- **Clarity (↑):** Provider quirks live behind an adapter; no hidden threshold magic.
- **Robustness (↑):** No SDK in planning → fewer failure modes; invariants are testable.
- **DX/Testability (↑):** No mocks required; unit tests assert ranges and policy.
- **Extensibility (↑):** New providers = new adapter; no planner rewrite.

## Policy & Invariants

### Planning policy

- Use `max_tokens` for safety-critical gates (batch sizing, caching eligibility).
- Use `expected_tokens` only for non-critical UX (progress, rough cost display).
- Never call provider SDKs during planning.

### Estimator invariants

- **Purity:** No I/O; do not read `content_loader`; deterministic for same inputs.
- **Monotonicity:** Adding content cannot decrease any bound.
- **Confidence semantics:** Mixed/heterogeneous content **must not** increase confidence.

### Validation invariants (post-execution)

- Record `actual_tokens`; compute `accuracy_ratio = actual / expected`.
- Record `in_range = (min_tokens ≤ actual ≤ max_tokens)`.
- Do **not** retroactively change the plan mid-run based on validation.

---

## Observability: Targeted Metrics to Track

- `token_estimation.estimate.expected_tokens`
- `token_estimation.estimate.max_tokens`
- `token_estimation.estimate.confidence`
- `token_estimation.breakdown.*`
- `token_validation.actual_tokens`
- `token_validation.accuracy_ratio`
- `token_validation.in_range` (boolean)

**Drift review cadence:** When `in_range=false` rate > 5% or the median `accuracy_ratio` shifts by >10% over two releases, publish a new bias version (e.g., `GeminiBiases.v2_*`) and update the adapter default.

---

## Contract Tests (Definition of Done)

- **Purity:** Same inputs → same `TokenEstimate`; no file/system/network access.
- **Monotonicity:** Append a source; all bounds stay ≥ previous.
- **Conservatism:** For corpus X, ≥95% of actuals fall within `[min,max]`; misses skew to **over-estimation**.
- **Mixed content:** Confidence strictly decreases vs. homogeneous content of same size.
- **Planner gating:** `max_tokens` is the only value used for cache/batch gating.
- **Validation wiring:** API Handler emits `actual_tokens`, `accuracy_ratio`, `in_range`.

---

## Open Questions / TODOs

- **Bounds policy:** Confirm whether certain flows prefer `expected` for UX (e.g., progress bars) while still using `max` for safety-critical gating.
- **Breakdown granularity:** Decide whether to surface per-source breakdown in user-visible metrics or keep it internal.
- **Model switching:** Finalize how multi-provider commands are partitioned or handled with worst-case rules.
- **Bias versioning cadence:** Define a policy for publishing/retiring bias versions (e.g., `v1_august_2025`, `v2_…`).
