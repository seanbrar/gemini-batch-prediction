# Architecture Decisions (ADRs)

Purpose: Capture significant technical decisions, alternatives considered, and their consequences. These documents provide historical context and traceability.

How to read:

- Each ADR is numbered and scoped (e.g., command pipeline, telemetry).
- Status indicates whether the decision is accepted, superseded, or proposed.
- Prefer ADRs for rationale; prefer Reference for current factual APIs.

Orientation:

- If you’re new, start with “Architecture at a Glance,” then skim ADR titles here to map the landscape.
- Use ADRs to understand “why,” not “how to.”
