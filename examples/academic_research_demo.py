Academic Research Demo: Multi-Source Literature Analysis

Demonstrates analyzing multiple research sources (papers, videos, web content)
simultaneously using structured output and cross-source synthesis.

This example shows how to:
- Process mixed content types in a single batch
- Use structured output for systematic analysis
- Perform cross-source synthesis
- Analyze source composition and efficiency

Adapt this template for your own research questions and sources.
