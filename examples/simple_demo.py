Minimal demonstration of the Gemini Batch Processing Framework

Shows the core interface: ask multiple questions about content in a single call.
This is the simplest possible example - see examples/ for advanced features,
efficiency analysis, and multi-source processing capabilities.

Perfect starting point for understanding how the framework works.
