## üåê External Sources

**arXiv Paper**: [Distilling the Knowledge in a Neural Network (Hinton et al., 2015)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.02531)
*Geoffrey Hinton, Oriol Vinyals, and Jeff Dean - Foundational knowledge distillation paper*

**YouTube Lecture**: [Efficient AI Computing | Song Han | TEDxMIT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1_K4UeAl-s)
*Song Han (MIT) - December 2024 - Contemporary perspective on efficient AI model design and "Deep Compression" techniques*

## üéØ Why These Sources?

This collection was chosen to demonstrate:

1. **Diverse Techniques**: Pruning, quantization, distillation, architecture design, data-centric approaches
2. **Temporal Range**: Papers from 2015-2025 showing evolution of the field
3. **Source Variety**: Research papers, surveys, perspectives, and multimedia content
4. **Authority & Impact**: Includes foundational papers (Hinton's distillation) and leading researchers (Song Han's recent work)
5. **Cross-Reference Potential**: Papers that cite and build upon each other
6. **Practical Relevance**: Techniques actively used in production systems

**Notable Connections**:
- Song Han's work appears in both the YouTube talk and several referenced papers
- Knowledge distillation (Hinton et al.) is covered in multiple papers and the contemporary survey
- Pruning techniques span from early work (Han 2015) to recent advances (Lottery Ticket Hypothesis)

## üîß Usage in Examples

These sources are used in:
- `researcher_demo.py` - Multi-source batch processing demo
- `researcher_demo.ipynb` - Interactive Jupyter notebook version

**Example Research Questions**:
- "What are the main efficiency techniques proposed across all sources?"
- "Which approaches show the most promising results based on collective evidence?"
- "What gaps exist in current AI efficiency research based on these sources?"
