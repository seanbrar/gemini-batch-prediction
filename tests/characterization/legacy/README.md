# Legacy Characterization Goldens (Historical Artifacts)

These YAML files are historical golden artifacts preserved for reference. They reflect the behavior of the preâ€‘v1 architecture and are intentionally not executed as tests.

Notes

- These files do not represent the current v1 API surface or intended behavior.
- The former legacy tests have been removed to reduce maintenance and avoid confusion.
- When a new characterization suite is built for the v1 API, it will live under `tests/characterization/` and may use `pytest-golden` (kept as a dev dependency).

Scope

- This directory is not part of any test lane. CI and local `pytest` runs do not execute anything here.
