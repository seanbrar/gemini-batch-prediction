## 1. Abstract

The current architecture successfully decouples caching logic from the `GeminiClient` by using a "Wrapper" pattern, where `CacheManager.generate_with_cache` wraps the client's raw generation function. This is a significant improvement.

This document proposes an evolution of that design to a **Planner-Executor** pattern with **Direct Action** capability. In this model, the `CacheManager`'s role is simplified further: it transitions from an active orchestrator to a stateless **Planner** that takes direct action when it has sufficient information. It analyzes a request and returns a simple, descriptive "action plan." The `GeminiClient` then acts as an **Executor**, reading the plan and performing the corresponding action.

This change aims for radical simplicity, making the control flow flatter, more readable, and significantly easier to test and maintain by eliminating unnecessary abstraction layers.

## 2. The "Advise, Don't Act" Philosophy with Direct Action

The core principle of the Planner-Executor pattern is a strict separation of decision-making from action-taking, enhanced by the **Direct Action** principle.

* **The Planner (`CacheManager`):** Its sole responsibility is to make decisions. It inspects the content and context of a request and produces a recommendation. It answers the question, *"What should be done?"* It does not execute generation calls, handle retries, or process responses. Its only side effects are interactions with the Gemini Caches API (`client.caches.create`, `client.caches.get`). 

* **Direct Action Principle:** When the Planner has sufficient information to perform its allowed side effects (cache creation), it should act directly rather than delegating to methods that repeat analysis. This eliminates unnecessary abstraction layers while maintaining the core separation of concerns.

* **The Executor (`GeminiClient`):** Its responsibility is to act. It receives the plan from the Planner and executes the specified action. It answers the question, *"How is it done?"* It trusts the Planner's decision and does not need to know the reasoning behind it.

This pattern eliminates the need for passing function callbacks (`raw_generation_func`) and removes complex, nested control flows, replacing them with a simple, linear sequence: **Plan -> Execute**.

## 3. Key Components

### 3.1. The `CacheAction` and Type-Safe Payloads

The centerpiece of this pattern is a set of simple, immutable data classes that create a type-safe contract between the Planner and the Executor.

```python
# In gemini_batch/client/models.py
from dataclasses import dataclass
from enum import Enum, auto
from typing import List, Union
from google.genai import types

# --- Payloads ---
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class PartsPayload:
    """Payload for actions that only require a list of parts."""
    parts: List[types.Part]

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class ExplicitCachePayload:
    """Payload for generating from an explicit cache."""
    cache_name: str
    parts: List[types.Part] # The prompt parts, not the cached content

# --- Strategy Enum ---
class CacheStrategy(Enum):
    GENERATE_RAW = auto()
    GENERATE_WITH_OPTIMIZED_PARTS = auto() # Implicit Caching
    GENERATE_FROM_EXPLICIT_CACHE = auto()

# --- The Action Plan ---
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class CacheAction:
    """An immutable plan describing the caching action to be taken."""
    strategy: CacheStrategy
    payload: Union[PartsPayload, ExplicitCachePayload]
```

* **Specific Payloads**: Using PartsPayload and ExplicitCachePayload ensures that the Executor receives exactly the data it needs for each strategy, enforced by the type checker. This prevents runtime errors and improves developer experience.
* **`strategy`**: The `Enum` provides a clear, readable, and type-safe way to define the action.

### 3.2. The `CacheManager` (The Planner)

The `CacheManager` is refactored to contain one primary public method: `plan_generation`, with focused utility methods that embody the Direct Action principle.

* **Responsibility**: Analyzes content, determines the caching strategy, manages the state of the cache objects (creating/retrieving them via the API), and returns a `CacheAction`.
* **Key Characteristic**: It is **robust and stateless** regarding the generation request itself. It does not execute generation calls, handle retries, or process responses. Its only side effects are interactions with the Gemini Caches API (`client.caches.create`, `client.caches.get`). It gracefully handles its own side-effect failures (e.g., cache creation) by degrading to a simpler plan.
* **Direct Action**: When sufficient information is available, it takes direct action (cache creation) rather than delegating to methods that repeat analysis.

```python
# In gemini_batch/client/cache_manager.py
class CacheManager:
    # ...

    def plan_generation(self, ...):
        # ... main planning logic remains as is ...

    def _ensure_explicit_cache(self, parts: List[types.Part], ...) -> CacheInfo:
        """
        Ensures an explicit cache exists for the content.
        Handles content hashing, checks for an existing cache, and creates a new one
        via _create_cache if needed. Raises APIError on failure.
        """
        # Implementation details omitted for brevity...
        pass

    def _prepare_cache_parts(self, parts: List[types.Part]) -> Tuple[List[types.Part], List[types.Part]]:
        """
        Separates cacheable content from prompt parts using the content_processor.
        Includes fallback logic to ensure the prompt is never empty.
        """
        # Implementation details omitted for brevity...
        pass
```

### 3.3. The `GeminiClient` (The Executor)

The `GeminiClient._execute_generation` method becomes radically simplified. Its logic is reduced to a simple dispatch table based on the `CacheAction.strategy`.

```python
# In gemini_batch/gemini_client.py
class GeminiClient:
    def _execute_generation(self, ...):
        parts = self.content_processor.process(content)

        # 1. Get the plan from the Planner
        action = self.cache_manager.plan_generation(parts) if self.cache_manager else \
                 CacheAction(strategy=CacheStrategy.GENERATE_RAW, payload=PartsPayload(parts=parts))

        # 2. Execute the plan
        raw_response = None
        if action.strategy == CacheStrategy.GENERATE_RAW:
            raw_response = self._generate_with_parts(action.payload.parts, ...)
        
        elif action.strategy == CacheStrategy.GENERATE_WITH_OPTIMIZED_PARTS:
            raw_response = self._generate_with_parts(action.payload.parts, ...)

        elif action.strategy == CacheStrategy.GENERATE_FROM_EXPLICIT_CACHE:
            raw_response = self._generate_with_cache_reference(
                cache_name=action.payload.cache_name,
                prompt_parts=action.payload.parts,
                ...
            )
        
        # 3. Process the response (responsibility remains with the client)
        return self._process_response(raw_response, ...)
```

## 4. Architectural Benefits

This pattern yields significant improvements in key areas:

1. **Radical Simplicity & Readability**: The control flow in `GeminiClient` is no longer nested or callback-driven. It is a flat, descriptive `if/elif` block. The logic is immediately understandable: get a plan, execute the plan. The `CacheManager` eliminates unnecessary abstraction layers through the Direct Action principle.

2. **Superior Testability**:
    * **Testing the Planner (`CacheManager`)**: Becomes trivial. It's a nearly pure function with focused utility methods. You provide input (`parts`) and assert that the correct `CacheAction` with the correct payload type is returned. No mocking of complex method chains is required.
    * **Testing the Executor (`GeminiClient`)**: Becomes declarative. You can mock `cache_manager.plan_generation` to return a specific `CacheAction` and assert that the correct internal generation method is called with the correct payload.

3. **Maximum Decoupling & Robustness**: The components are now more decoupled than ever.
    * `CacheManager` knows nothing about retries, response parsing, or high-level error handling. It handles its own specific errors and degrades gracefully.
    * `GeminiClient` knows nothing about the *logic* of TTL calculation, content hashing, or token thresholds for caching. It only needs to know how to act on the final decision.

4. **Maintainability & Extensibility**: Adding a new caching strategy is a clean, localized process:
    1. Add a new value to the `CacheStrategy` enum.
    2. Create a new payload dataclass if needed.
    3. Add the logic to `CacheManager.plan_generation` to return the new `CacheAction`.
    4. Add an `elif` block to `GeminiClient._execute_generation` to handle the new strategy.
    The existing components and logic paths remain untouched, minimizing the risk of regression.

5. **Elimination of Abstraction Layers**: The Direct Action principle removes unnecessary method chains and redundant analysis, resulting in code that is easier to understand and debug.

## 5. Conclusion

The Planner-Executor pattern with Direct Action represents a mature architectural choice that prioritizes clarity, testability, and long-term maintainability. By transforming the `CacheManager` from an active wrapper into a passive advisor that takes direct action when appropriate, we create a system where each component has a single, well-defined responsibility while eliminating unnecessary complexity.

This radically simple approach results in code that is easier to reason about, safer to modify, and more robust in its execution. The Direct Action principle ensures that when the Planner has sufficient information, it acts immediately rather than creating additional abstraction layers that repeat analysis.

It is the recommended architectural direction for the `CacheManager` and `GeminiClient` interaction.
