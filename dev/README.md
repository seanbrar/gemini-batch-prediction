# Development Documentation

This directory contains development-focused documentation that explains the "why" and "how" behind implementation decisions.

## Structure

- **Implementation Guides** (`logging.md`, `telemetry_internals.md`): How existing systems work
- **Design Proposals** (`design/`): Architectural proposals and explorations

**What you'll find here:**

- Architectural design decisions and rationale
- Implementation philosophy and best practices
- Internal system explanations for contributors
- Development workflow and debugging guidance

**What you won't find here:**

- User-facing "how to use" guides (see `docs/` instead)
- Basic setup or installation instructions
- API reference or usage examples

This documentation is more technical and implementation-focused than the main docs, but it's kept public to help future contributors understand the reasoning behind design choices.
