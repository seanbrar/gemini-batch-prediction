# src/gemini_batch/config/__init__.py

"""Configuration management for the Gemini Batch Pipeline.

This module provides the new Pydantic Two-File Core configuration system
that replaces the previous multi-file approach with a clean, data-centric design.

The core principle is resolve-once, freeze-then-flow: configuration is resolved
at entry points into immutable FrozenConfig objects that flow through the pipeline.

Key exports:
- resolve_config: Main API for configuration resolution
- FrozenConfig: Immutable configuration payload for pipeline
- config_scope: Context manager for scoped configuration
- Settings: Pydantic schema for validation and defaults
