"""Chunking utilities for long text and transcripts.

Goal: provide slim, ergonomic functions that examples can use to keep scripts
clean while leveraging library token estimation heuristics. These helpers are
provider-neutral at the API level and default to the Gemini estimation adapter
to approximate token counts.

APIs:
- chunk_text_by_tokens: split long text into token-bounded chunks with overlap
- chunk_transcript_by_tokens: split a list of (start,end,text) into chunks

Notes:
- Token counts are approximate and based on the same heuristics used by the
  planner's estimation adapter. Chunks aim to be <= target_tokens but may be
  slightly over or under due to boundary choices.
- Overlap is applied in tokens and approximated over word boundaries for text;
  for transcripts, the last segments are re-included to achieve approximate
  overlap.
